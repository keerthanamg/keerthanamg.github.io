## Work Experience
**Team lead @ Navachethana Wellness Foundation (_January 2025 - October 2025_)**
- Led and coordinated cross-functional teams across the foundation’s key initiatives in health & wellness, education, women empowerment, and environment.
- Managed project planning, volunteer engagement, and outreach activities to ensure smooth execution of welfare programs and measurable community impact.
- Actively contributed innovative ideas to introduce digital tools and data-driven practices within the foundation’s operations, laying the foundation for future technology-driven initiatives.
- This role helped me strengthen my leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving skills while understanding the power of innovation in social service.

**Prompt Engineer @ Zensar Technologies Ltd. (_October 2024 - January 2025_)**
- Currently working on a project with NVIDIA on advanced data-driven projects, focusing on prompt engineering, data annotation, image classification, and labeling to support machine learning models.
- I contribute to refining AI systems by ensuring high-quality datasets and enhancing the accuracy of computer vision algorithms.

**Artificial Intelligence Intern @ Pantech Solutions (_March 2024 - June 2024_)**
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams on real-time AI projects.
-  Gained hands-on experience in building and fine-tuning Gen AI models, ensuring high accuracy and performance across live applications.

**Machine Learning Intern @ Take IT Smart OPC Pvt Ltd (_February 2024 - March 2024_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the data to provide recommendations for optimizing communication strategies and tailoring product offerings to better meet customer needs.
- Worked on end-to-end project, building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in client service or not. It will be extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

**Data Science and Business Analytics Intern @ The Sparks Foundation (_September 2023 - October 2023_)**
- Led testing efforts for real-time data automation projects to ensure flawless execution.

- Contributed my work towards Unsupervised Machine Learning projects.
- Led 3 premium projects with a team of 3 members

## Projects
### 1. Generative AI-Powered Medical QA System with Document Retrieval
Tools Technologies: Langchain, Sentence Transformers, ChromaDB, LLaMA, PyPDF, Python
- Developed a Medical Assistance QA system that processes and retrieves relevant information from medical PDFs to answer user queries related to healthcare, focusing on conditions like heart disease.
- Employed LLaMA (LlamaCpp) to build a generative AI model capable of providing accurate and context-aware medical responses.
- Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, combining document retrieval with LLaMA’s generative capabilities to deliver fact-based answers and LLM-driven responses allowing users to interact in a real-time query environment.


  
### 2. Website Performance Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of the website’s performance, based on:
- Session Analysis: Understanding traffic trends.
- User Engagement Analysis: Gauging the depth of user interaction.
- Channel Performance: Evaluating which channels are most effective.
- Website Traffic Forecasting: Predicting future traffic patterns

### 3. Parkinson Disease Detection
Final year major project using LSTM and CNN to detect the disease at early stages.
- Team members: Keerthana MG, Nivedha S, Sahana R, Sindhu MG.
- Parkinsons disease (PD) is a challenging neurode-generative disorder to diagnose due to its variable symptoms and lack of definitive biomarkers. This project aims to detect this disease at early stages of patients using Gait analysis.
- Advancements in machine learning, particularly CNN and LSTM architectures, provide a unique opportunity to revolutionize PD diagnosis.
- Comparing with other models, our proposed model gained the accuracy of 95.6 percentage.

  

### 4. An Analytics Dashboard
An analytics dashboard is a data visualization tool that aggregates, displays, and analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics, and other key data points related to a business, department, or specific process.

### 5. Statistical Modelling
Statistical modelling is a form of mathematical modelling that involves statistics to estimate or predict real-world behaviours, trends, and future outcomes based on data. It involves the construction of a statistical model, which is a formal representation of relationships between variables, typically expressed in the form of mathematical equations.
