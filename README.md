# Prompt Engineer @ Zensar Technologies Ltd.
As a Prompt Engineer at Zensar Technologies, I focus on optimizing and advancing the performance of cutting-edge AI systems. My expertise lies in crafting and refining high-quality prompts for a variety of AI models, encompassing tasks such as conversational AI, content summarization, video descriptions, and image/video caption generation.

I specialize in evaluating both human and AI-generated prompt-response pairs, providing in-depth feedback, and implementing improvements to enhance accuracy and relevance. With a focus on generative AI and natural language processing (NLP), I consistently work on improving response quality across multiple parameters, ensuring seamless AI-human interaction.

My background in data science, machine learning, and Generative AI gives me a strong foundation in fine-tuning AI systems. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve, constantly refining models to deliver results that are both practical and innovative.

## Projects
### 1. Generative AI-Powered Medical QA System with Document Retrieval
Tools Technologies: Langchain, Sentence Transformers, ChromaDB, LLaMA, PyPDF, Python
- Developed a Medical Assistance QA system that processes and retrieves relevant information from medical PDFs to answer user queries related to healthcare, focusing on conditions like heart disease.
- Employed LLaMA (LlamaCpp) to build a generative AI model capable of providing accurate and context-aware medical responses.
- Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, combining document retrieval with LLaMA’s generative capabilities to deliver fact-based answers and LLM-driven responses allowing users to interact in a real-time query environment.


  
### 2. Website Performance Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of the website’s performance, based on:
- Session Analysis: Understanding traffic trends.
- User Engagement Analysis: Gauging the depth of user interaction.
- Channel Performance: Evaluating which channels are most effective.
- Website Traffic Forecasting: Predicting future traffic patterns

### 3. Parkinson Disease Detection
Final year major project using LSTM and CNN to detect the disease at early stages.
- Team members: Keerthana MG, Nivedha S, Sahana R, Sindhu MG.
- Parkinsons disease (PD) is a challenging neurode-generative disorder to diagnose due to its variable symptoms and lack of definitive biomarkers. This project aims to detect this disease at early stages of patients using Gait analysis.
- Advancements in machine learning, particularly CNN and LSTM architectures, provide a unique opportunity to revolutionize PD diagnosis.
- Comparing with other models, our proposed model gained the accuracy of 95.6 percentage.

  

### 4. An Analytics Dashboard
An analytics dashboard is a data visualization tool that aggregates, displays, and analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics, and other key data points related to a business, department, or specific process.

### 5. Statistical Modelling
Statistical modelling is a form of mathematical modelling that involves statistics to estimate or predict real-world behaviours, trends, and future outcomes based on data. It involves the construction of a statistical model, which is a formal representation of relationships between variables, typically expressed in the form of mathematical equations.
